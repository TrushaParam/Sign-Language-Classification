This Project provides an opportunity to apply deep learning techniques to a meaningful application: classifying hand poses in sign language to facilitate better communication for the hearing impaired. By adhering to a rigorous workflow from data visualization to model deployment, develop a robust solution that enhances accessibility and communication. The project emphasizes technical proficiency and the importance of clear interpretation and communication of results in applications that have real-world social impacts.
